    "The dataset used in this project is titled **“Airbnb Prices in European Cities”**, published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities). It was assembled with **scraped data of the publicly available sources of Airbnb listings**. Such listings have specific metadata like the price, the room features, the satisfaction and cleanliness level, the geographic position, and the availability of the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the original Kaggle dataset lacks any particular code on web scraping, we can infer that the data was scraped by the process of **automated crawling of the Airbnb platform** over a series of cities of Europe on the basis of the structure and the naming of the variables. Every listing represents only one available property at one particular time.\n",
